Ridge and lasso regression are two regularization techniques used in machine learning to improve the performance of linear regression models. They both work by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which penalizes the size of the model coefficients. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.


Ridge regression penalizes the squared sum of the coefficients, while lasso regression penalizes the absolute sum of the coefficients. This means that ridge regression tends to shrink all of the coefficients towards zero, while lasso regression can shrink some of the coefficients to exactly zero. This makes lasso regression more effective for feature selection, as it can identify and eliminate features that are not important for predicting the target variable.


Which regularization technique to use depends on the specific problem being solved. Ridge regression is a good general-purpose regularization technique, while lasso regression is better suited for problems where feature selection is important.

Here are some examples of when to use ridge and lasso regression:

Ridge regression:
When you have a lot of features and you are not sure which ones are important for predicting the target variable.
When you want to avoid overfitting.
Lasso regression:
When you want to identify and eliminate unimportant features.
When you want to build a simpler and more interpretable model.
Both ridge and lasso regression are powerful regularization techniques that can be used to improve the performance of linear regression models. The best way to choose which technique to use is to experiment with both and see which one works best for your specific problem.

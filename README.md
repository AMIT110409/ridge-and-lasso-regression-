# ridge-and-lasso-regression-
Ridge and lasso regression are two regularization techniques used in machine learning to improve the performance of linear regression models. They both work by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which penalizes the size of the model coefficients. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.
